# Default config example

This example shows the minimal way to run this image; it
just uses the default Firebase config to run the image.
By default, this runs:

1. The authentication service
2. The Firebase Emulator UI will be enabled and exposed at [http://localhost:8083/](http://localhost:8083/).

To run this example, run `docker compose up` from this directory.
